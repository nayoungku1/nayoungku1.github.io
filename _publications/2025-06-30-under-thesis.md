This paper is my undergraduate thesis, supervised by Prof. Taejin Ahn. It addresses the challenge of early and accurate diagnosis of ovarian cancer, which is hindered by the lack of reliable biomarkers and the complexity of transcriptomic data. I developed a novel RNA-seq ETL pipeline that treats raw sequencing data as a biological language: nucleotide sequences are tokenized at the gene level, translated into amino acid sequences, embedded using a pretrained transformer model (ProtBERT), and classified with a Bi-LSTM network to distinguish cancerous from non-cancerous samples. 

This approach achieved an AUC of 0.7067 on the test set, demonstrating that contextual embeddings can capture disease-related signals. Beyond classification, the embeddings generated by this method provide meaningful insights, highlighting the potential of applying language models and natural language processing techniques to sequencing data analysis.
