Reviewed the study *“Antioxidant enzymes in chickpea colonized by Piriformospora indica participate in defense against the pathogen Botrytis cinerea.”*  
Discussed early-phase defense mechanisms in plant–microbe interactions, including defense gene activation, H₂O₂ accumulation, and the regulation of antioxidant enzyme levels.  
Explored the tripartite interaction among the arbuscular mycorrhizal fungus (*Piriformospora indica*), the host plant (chickpea), and the necrotrophic pathogen (*Botrytis cinerea*).  
Introduced biochemical assays such as the Bradford assay used to quantify antioxidant enzyme activity in plant defense studies.
