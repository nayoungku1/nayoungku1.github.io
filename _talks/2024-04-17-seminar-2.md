Reviewed the paper by Mirabella et al. (2021), *“Prenatal interleukin-6 elevation increases glutamatergic synapse density and disrupts hippocampal connectivity in offspring.”*  
Discussed the mechanisms of synaptogenesis and functional connectivity, emphasizing the excitation–inhibition (E/I) balance in neurotransmission especially excitatory postsynaptic potential generated by glutamatergic transmission.  
Introduced experimental approaches including fMRI, single-cell genomic analysis, and patch-clamp electrophysiology to investigate neuroimmune modulation of brain circuit development. [[PPT]](/files/2024-04-17-seminar.pdf)
