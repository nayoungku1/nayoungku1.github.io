Reviewed the paper by Kim et al. (2022), *“Maternal gut bacteria drive intestinal inflammation in offspring with neurodevelopmental disorders by altering the chromatin landscape of CD4⁺ T cells.”*  
Discussed key concepts including epigenetics, neurodevelopmental disorders, and the maternal–fetal gut microbiota axis.  
Also explained experimental methods and analytical tools such as ATAC-seq and Gene Ontology (GO) analysis in the context of epigenetic regulation.
