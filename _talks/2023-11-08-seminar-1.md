Reviewed the paper of Kim et al. (2022), *“Maternal gut bacteria drive intestinal inflammation in offspring with neurodevelopmental disorders by altering the chromatin landscape of CD4⁺ T cells.”*  
Explored the interplay between the maternal–fetal gut microbiota axis and neurodevelopmental disorders through the lens of epigenetics.  
Discussed experimental approaches such as ATAC-seq and Gene Ontology (GO) analysis that reveal chromatin accessibility and gene-regulatory mechanisms underlying immune–neural interactions.
