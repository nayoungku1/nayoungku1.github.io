I am an undergraduate student at [Handong Global University](https://www.handong.edu/eng/), studying Life Science & AI interdisciplinary studies. I obtained a BA in Psychology at the National Institute for Lifelong Education when I was a high school senior (at age 18).

I love tackling problems from fresh angles: approaching biomedical research like a computer geek, and building AI through the lens of cognitive neuroscience. 
I believe in the power of interdisciplinary areas where the best ideas often emerge.
