### "See the invisible, do the impossible"

I am an undergraduate student at [Handong Global University](https://www.handong.edu/eng/), studying Life Science & AI interdisciplinary studies, where I build foundational machine learning models to decode the language of biology. Previously, I obtained a BA in Psychology at the National Institute for Lifelong Education when I was a high school senior.

I believe the genome is a language system where generative and representation learning can uncover regulatory patterns that standard differential expression analysis misses. My central research question is how we can learn a unified representation from biology's complementary languages: the linear text of the genome, the 3D syntax of protein structures, and the visual context of cellular images. My goal is not just to find a specific biomarker, but to build the fundamental generative models‚Äîlike VAEs and Transformers‚Äîthat decode the latent regulatory grammar hidden within the 'ATGC vocabulary.' Also, I aim to engineer robust, accessible software libraries and tools that empower the broader scientific community.
