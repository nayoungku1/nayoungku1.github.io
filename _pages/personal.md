I’m driven by curiosity, creativity, and the joy of seeing ideas come to life. I finish what I start, learn quickly, and enjoy bringing people together to share what we know.

I value persistence, adaptability, and the humility to keep learning. 

## Creative Projects

**I have been expressing ideas through writing and visual art.**
At 17, I published a [book](https://product.kyobobook.co.kr/detail/S000060619640) of stories, poems, and essays—doing the writing, illustrations, and layout myself. I also led a team creating a magazine that featured interviews with business leaders across different industries.

Seeing these projects through from vision to finished product taught me how to break complex work into manageable steps, balance creative vision with execution, and iterate until the result clicks.

## Learning Across Boundaries
**I’ve always been drawn to exploring across disciplines.** 
My path to research started with psychology. I completed my bachelor’s degree in two years through a self-directed program, initially drawn to general questions about human. 
Along the way, I discovered cognitive neuroscience and eventually the intersection of AI and biology.

During undergrad, I participated in **Lunch & Learn** session where peers and I taught each other up-to-date tools, concepts, research findings or interests over lunch. That collaborative learning energy—where everyone both teaches and learns—**reinforced my love of collaborative exploration.** 

I want to bring Lunch & Learn wherever I go!

## Outdoor Adventures & Resilience
Surfing near campus, hiking national parks, or running for miles—these are my reset buttons. 
At 12, I completed a **150km trek** across Korea for five days, carrying all my gear. **It taught me to persist through long, uncertain challenges**—lessons that still guide how I tackle complex projects today.

## Adaptability & Connection
**I adapt quickly and connect with diverse perspectives.**
Between boarding school and residential college, I've lived with 30+ roommates from different backgrounds. At university, I served as an exchange student helper for those from France, Pakistan, and Spain navigate academic and cultural adjustment.
