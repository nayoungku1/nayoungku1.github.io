excerpt: "Capstone Project advised by Prof. <b>Taejin Ahn</b> (Fall 2024). Developed an <b>LLM-based RNA-seq ETL workflow</b> for ovarian cancer classification. RNA-seq data from patients and healthy individuals were embedded using <b>ProtBERT</b> and classified via <b>LSTM</b>, achieving a test <b>AUC=0.7067</b>. <a href='/files/2024-11-28-capstone.pdf'>[PPT]</a> <a href='https://docs.google.com/document/d/1UEWebch9GVyAbMdlCCQBrFWcQjaMwg682n0BaDMayHM/edit?usp=sharing'>[Report]</a>"
